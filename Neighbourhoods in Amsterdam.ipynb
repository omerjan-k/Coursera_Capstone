    "####  Amsterdam, the city author works, attracting millions of tourists every year because of its stunning<br> <br> architecture, rich culture, history and nightlife. While enjoying this beautiful city, eating a delicious<br> <br> meal ideally meets  tourists'  expectations. However, finding the right place to eat can be a challenge,<br> <br> though. Different tourists prefer different dishes due to  different backgrounds, cultures and religions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thus, the goal of this exercise is to give a simple recommendation to tourists in Amsterdam: in which  <br><br>district (neighbourhood) of the city fit their needs in terms of food venues. For instance, Where to <br><br>eat Mediterranean food, where to find Turkish food, where to get fast food?\n"
